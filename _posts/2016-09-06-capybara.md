title: always use Capybara matchers first
categories: rails concurrency
---

There's a deep well of blog posts out there about using
[Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara). I wanted to add one
recent observation I had that I hadn't seen.

Capybara made the choice to abstract away from you its concurrency
control. For the most part, this is nice. But I think every person that's
ever used this library has dealt with intermittent failures. The
background on that topic in general is handled [better
elsewhere](http://technotes.iangreenleaf.com/posts/the-one-true-guide-to-database-transactions-with-capybara.html).

The issue I want to highlight comes with mixing testing APIs without
knowing the work Capybara is doing for you.

Here's an example from RSpec:

```ruby
  expect(Model.last.name).to eq('model name')
  expect(page).to have_text('model name')
```

Probably looks fine on first blush. But over enough runs you'll likely see
intermittent failures. Why? Because while the Capybara matcher `have_text`
is handling concurrency correctly, the RSpec matcher `eq` is not! In this
example, the model might not be created yet, but will be once `have_text`
has finished waiting for it.

Simply resequencing these two lines will save you the failures. Better
yet, you should probably not be using anything _but_ Capybara matchers in
your feature tests.

To that end, I forked
[rubocop-rspec](https://github.com/nevir/rubocop-rspec) and created an
example `Cop` to catch sequencing errors like this in static analysis:

```ruby
require 'capybara/rspec/matchers'
require 'rspec/matchers'

module RuboCop
  module Cop
    module RSpec
      # When using acceptance testing with Capybara, using
      # non-Capybara matchers before Capybara matchers will
      # introduce intermittent failures and should be avoided.
      #
      # @example
      #   # bad
      #   it '...' do
      #     expect(Model.last.name).to eq('model name')
      #     expect(page).to have_text('model name')
      #   end
      #
      #   # better
      #   it '...' do
      #     expect(page).to have_text('model name')
      #     expect(Model.last.name).to eq('model name')
      #   end
      #
      #   # best
      #   it '...' do
      #     expect(page).to have_text('model name')
      #   end
      class CapybaraOrdering < Cop
        include RuboCop::RSpec::SpecOnly,
          RuboCop::RSpec::Language

        MSG = 'To maintain Capybara concurrency protection,' \
          ' swap the line sequence of `%{one}` and `%{two}`.'.freeze

        # capybara and rspec intersect on some methods, leading to
        # ambiguous cases. right now we're just handling `within` but
        # moving to an explicit whitelist or a configurable one might
        # be necessary to really parse a full codebase
        SAFE_MATCHERS = Capybara::RSpecMatchers.instance_methods(false).
          push(:within).freeze
        UNSAFE_MATCHERS = ::RSpec::Matchers.instance_methods(false).
          tap {|h| h.delete(:expect) }.tap {|h| h.delete(:within) }.freeze
        ALL_MATCHERS = SAFE_MATCHERS + UNSAFE_MATCHERS

        def_node_matcher :example?, <<-PATTERN
          (block (send _ {#{Examples::ALL.to_node_pattern}} ...) ...)
        PATTERN

        def_node_search :matcher, <<-PATTERN
          (send _ {
        #{ALL_MATCHERS.to_s.delete('[]').gsub(',',"\n")}
          }
         ...)
        PATTERN

        def on_block(node)
          return unless example?(node) && (matchers = matcher(node))
          return if matchers.to_a.size <= 1

          one = matchers.next
          two = matchers.next

          if UNSAFE_MATCHERS.include?(one.method_name) && SAFE_MATCHERS.include?(two.method_name)
            add_offense(one, :expression, MSG % { one: one.method_name, two: two.method_name} )
          end
        end

        def autocorrect(node)
          matchers = matcher(node.parent.parent)

          one = matchers.next
          two = matchers.next

          lambda do |corrector|
            safe = two.parent
            unsafe = one.parent

            corrector.replace(unsafe.loc.expression, safe.source)
            corrector.replace(safe.loc.expression, unsafe.source)
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

This includes an `#autocorrect` method so you can run `rubocop -a` to fix these problems. You can see
[this](https://github.com/mooreniemi/rubocop-rspec/blob/master/lib/rubocop/cop/rspec/capybara_ordering.rb)
and its
[spec](https://github.com/mooreniemi/rubocop-rspec/blob/master/spec/rubocop/cop/rspec/capybara_ordering_spec.rb)
in their original context on
[github](https://github.com/mooreniemi/rubocop-rspec/blob/master/spec/rubocop/cop/rspec/capybara_ordering_spec.rb). I've only used this `Cop` on one system, and it is imperfect as written. But I think it could be a fruitful direction, so feel free to hack on it.
