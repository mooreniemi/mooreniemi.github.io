title: dijkstra's algorithm
---

I was just as guilty as many programmers when you ask them what Dijkstra's
algorithm is: "oh it's BFS with a priority queue..." This made me think
one could just drop in a `PQueue` where one had been using a `Queue` and
you'd be all set. Well, sorta.

Ironically, the [original
algorithm](http://www.cse.unt.edu/~tarau/teaching/AnAlgo/Dijkstra's%20algorithm.pdf)
didn't use a priority queue at all! But subsequent innovation added it,
and though I won't be using a Fibonacci Heap underneath for the truly
speediest implementation, I did implement it with `pqueue`.

Having finally taken a crack at implementing the algorithm, I'd
distinguish it from BFS not by the priority queue per se but by the
emphasis on edge weights. The importance of the priority queue is
a consequence of wanting to find the smallest weight efficiently.
Dijkstra's algorithm solves BFS as a special case: the case where
a weighted graph's edges are all of the same weight.

This is where I'd point out the difference first: how we write our `Node`
class. With BFS, our nodes don't need to store weights between
edges; nodes only need to store an adjacency list of other `Node`s
(pointers/references to nodes). Optionally, you can store distance (from
root) and a reference to the parent node in the `Node`, but it's fine to
just track those locally to the BFS function itself, too. (That's how
you'll see it in [most
psuedocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm#Pseudocode).)

```ruby
class Node
  attr_reader :value, :adj_list
  attr_accessor :distance, :parent

  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
    @parent = nil
    @distance = Float::INFINITY
    @adj_list = []
  end
end
```

Making a graph is then a matter of creating your nodes (vertices) and
linking them together (populating their adjacency lists).

```ruby
one = Node.new(1)
two = Node.new(2)
three = Node.new(3)
four = Node.new(4)
five = Node.new(5)

one.adj_list << two << three
two.adj_list << one
three.adj_list << one << four
four.adj_list << three << five
five.adj_list << four
```

We need to represent our graph with weights for Dijkstra's algorithm,
because duh, shortest path makes no sense if all the paths are the same.

I decided to do this just by adding `edge_list`, which is a `Hash`:

```ruby
class WeightedNode < Node
  attr_accessor :edge_list
  def initialize(value)
    @edge_list = {}
    super
  end
end
```

Then building the graph is pretty similar to the previous one, but every
pair of connected nodes (so, every edge) has a value:

```ruby
wone = WeightedNode.new(1)
wtwo = WeightedNode.new(2)
wthree = WeightedNode.new(3)
wfour = WeightedNode.new(4)

wone.edge_list[wtwo] = 4
wtwo.edge_list[wone] = 4
wtwo.edge_list[wthree] = 2
wthree.edge_list[wtwo] = 2
wfour.edge_list[wone] = 1
wone.edge_list[wfour] = 1
```

Now we have the structure we need (aside from the priority queue
implementation[^1] which I used [this
lib](https://github.com/rubyworks/pqueue) for) to calculate the shortest
distance to any and every[^2] node:

```ruby
  require 'pqueue'
  def dijkstra
    nodes.first.distance = 0
    pq = PQueue.new(nodes) { |a, b| a.distance < b.distance }

    until pq.empty?
      (current = pq.pop).edge_list.keys.each do |n|
        alt = current.distance + current.edge_list[n]
        if alt < n.distance
          n.distance = alt
          n.parent = current
        end
      end
    end

    nodes.map(&:value).zip(nodes.map(&:distance))
  end
end
```

This outputs: `[[1, 0], [2, 4], [3, 6], [4, 1]]`. (The node value, and the
minimum distance to that node.)

If I add a new path to the graph that allows us to reach, say, node
3 faster like so:

```ruby
wthree.edge_list[wfour] = 3
wfour.edge_list[wthree] = 3
```

Then my output the next time becomes: `[[1, 0], [2, 4], [3, 4], [4, 1]]`.

If we specifically want to target the search so we return a  path
from source to target we just need to do a little bit more work: we need
to trace the paths as they are happening, and we need to filter the output
for just the source-target path we want. We can do both steps in one if we
only track the paths we're targeting.

```ruby
  def shortest_path(source, target)
    source.distance = 0
    pq = PQueue.new(nodes) { |a, b| a.distance < b.distance }
    path = []

    until pq.empty?
      (current = pq.pop).edge_list.keys.each do |n|
        if n == target
          u = n
          until u.parent.nil?
            path << u.to_s unless path.include? u.to_s
            u = u.parent
          end
        end

        alt = current.distance + current.edge_list[n]
        if alt < n.distance
          n.distance = alt
          n.parent = current
        end
      end
    end

    path
  end
```

Now this expectation will pass: `expect(graph.shortest_path(wone,
wthree)).to eq([[3, 4], [4, 1]])`. (Each entry is the node value, then the
distance.) In other words, the shortest path to three is via four.

If we look at BFS, we can see how it could be rewritten to just use all
our machinery for Dijkstra's, but with no-ops wherever we were checking
weight (edge length):

```ruby
  def breadth_traversal
    nodes.first.distance = 0
    # we dont need to define <=>
    q = [nodes.first]

    until q.empty?
      # we only need adj_list, not edge_list
      (current = q.shift).adj_list.each do |n|
        # i am skipping the initial node
        next unless n.distance == Float::INFINITY
        # we dont need to define a candidate alt value
        n.distance = current.distance + 1
        n.parent = current
        # incidentally, i only added root node so
        # i have to add n to the queue manually
        q.unshift(n)
      end
    end

    self
  end
```

So it's not so much that we can drop a priority queue into BFS and get
what we need, but the opposite: we can ignore the fact we're using
a priority queue and get BFS if our nodes have equal weights. Anyway, if
you're curious to play around with my code it's available [on
github](https://github.com/mooreniemi/experiments/blob/master/spec/dijkstra_spec.rb).

[^1]: I found a [great guide](http://www.brianstorti.com/implementing-a-priority-queue-in-ruby/) for implementing a priority queue from scratch, which I may try out later.

[^2]: When I first [read through the algorithm](http://math.mit.edu/~rothvoss/18.304.3PM/Presentations/1-Melissa.pdf),
	I noticed this Lemma:

	> Lemma 1: Optimal Substructure
	>
	> The subpath of any shortest path is itself a shortest path.

	I was a bit confused at first, because I wasn't thinking about how the
	algorithm is calculating *all* the possible shortest paths.
