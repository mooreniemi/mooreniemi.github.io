title: prim's algorithm
---

A bit ago I covered [Dijkstra's
Algorithm](http://mooreniemi.github.io/cs/2016/09/05/dijkstra.html) which
I pointed out shares much in common with BFS because BFS is a special case
of Dijkstra's.

Relatedly, with just a _very_ minor change to Dijkstra's algorithm we can
derive another useful algorithm to find the [minimum spanning
tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree)! This is called
[Prim's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm). I'm
not going to go in depth on how Prim's works[^1], but just how close it is
to Dijkstra's.

Both depend on the same `Node` class:

```ruby
class Node
  attr_reader :value
  attr_accessor :parent, :distance

  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
    @parent = nil
    @distance = Float::INFINITY
  end

  def to_s
    [value, distance]
  end
end

class WeightedNode < Node
  attr_accessor :edge_list
  def initialize(value)
    @edge_list = {}
    super
  end
end
```

Then we just need to set up our `Node`s and put them into a graph. Here's
just a snippet of that plumbing (note we need to set the edge for both
nodes):

```ruby
one, two, three, four = Array.new(4) { |i| WeightedNode.new(i+1) }

one.edge_list[two] = 5
two.edge_list[one] = 5
```

Now we can play with graphs which are just `Struct`s of `Node`s and
compare how different Prim's and Dijkstra's look.

As a refresher, here's [my version
](https://github.com/mooreniemi/experiments/blob/master/spec/dijkstra_spec.rb)
of Dijkstra's:

```ruby
def dijkstra
  nodes.first.distance = 0
  pq = PQueue.new(nodes) { |a, b| a.distance < b.distance }

  until pq.empty?
    (current = pq.pop).edge_list.keys.each do |n|
      alt = current.distance + current.edge_list[n]
      if pq.include?(n) && alt < n.distance
        n.distance = alt
        n.parent = current
      end
    end
  end

  nodes.map(&:value).zip(nodes.map(&:distance))
end
```

And here's [my
version](https://github.com/mooreniemi/experiments/blob/master/spec/mst_spec.rb)
of Prim's:

```ruby
def prim
  nodes.first.distance = 0
  pq = PQueue.new(nodes) { |a, b| a.distance < b.distance }

  until pq.empty?
    (current = pq.pop).edge_list.keys.each do |n|
      alt = current.edge_list[n]
      if pq.include?(n) && alt < n.distance
        n.parent = current
        n.distance = alt
      end
    end
  end

  nodes.map(&:value).zip(nodes.map(&:distance))
end
```

Did you spot the difference?[^2]

It's a pretty subtle, and I hadn't noticed the similarity of these two
until I saw [this SO answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/25800210/1791856).
The "relaxing" function in Prim's doesn't accumulate. In a rough and
informal sense, Dijkstra's folds where Prim's just needs to map.

So in Prim's we have `alt = current.edge_list[n]` where in Dijkstra's we
have `alt = current.distance + current.edge_list[n]`.

In concrete terms, that means we can rewrite this as _one_ function, which
operates on one of two procs:

```ruby
def dijkstra_proc
  proc do |c, n|
    c.distance + c.edge_list[n]
  end
end
def prim_proc
  proc do |c, n|
    c.edge_list[n]
  end
end

def both
  fail unless block_given?
  nodes.first.distance = 0
  pq = PQueue.new(nodes) { |a, b| a.distance < b.distance }

  until pq.empty?
    (current = pq.pop).edge_list.keys.each do |n|
      alt = yield(current, n)
      if pq.include?(n) && alt < n.distance
        n.distance = alt
        n.parent = current
      end
    end
  end

  nodes.map(&:value).zip(nodes.map(&:distance))
end
```

Pretty neat, I think! You can contrast this more "flexible" implementation
to one designed specifically for
[Prim's](http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2012/12/15/prims-algorithm-using-a-heappriority-queue-in-ruby/).

Doing Prim's also alerted me to the downside of keeping `distance` on the
`Node`s as I've been doing. When I tried to run `#dijkstra` right after
`#prim` I got the wrong answer, as both algorithms are dependent on the
distances starting at `Float::INFINITY`.

They'll always bite you.
