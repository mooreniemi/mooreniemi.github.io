There's many tools engineers underuse, but I want to pick on three I don't
see discussed often: dates, affect, and agency.

# dates

Dates are the first technology of civilization, and the ultimate
forcing function, especially on knowledge work. Engineers should be able
to make date estimates even under high ambiguity. More than this,
engineers should **not fear the future!** If we're not defining it, who
is?

In practice, I've observed: i. engineers abdicate the tool by leaving
dates to their managers or project managers (we'll touch on this more in
the last tool), ii. engineers let cynicism in when engaging in rituals
like planning poker, and iii. engineers succumb to wishful thinking about
how much can get done by when because they don't introspect on their
previous performance using any data.

Planning poker can be useful to structure a conversation about the work
since two different estimates can force a debate. But I've never found it
to be an accurately predictive tool. Since it is often posed as
a sneaky way to get dates out of engineers without calling them dates,
I find engineers get resistant and dismissive eventually. A few years ago
I actually did some analysis on the points assigned by my team and found
that we couldn't really do non-linear pointing (Fibonacci points were
popular but humans end up scoring linearly basically anyway), and
ultimately there were just three buckets. Bucket one was work that took
less than a day. Bucket two was the average task time, which was about
3 days. And then finally bucket three were the longer outliers where
a work unit took more than a week.

What I have found to be most constructive and predictive is to evenly
size tasks as best you can and then [do project estimation based on
average cycle time for your
tasks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnPiOI77O88). This of course isn't
possible if you can't disambiguate the work into even chunks ahead of
time, but you can actually still use historical task data to understand
how many chunks you can do by when in an approximate way. If you want
a rule of thumb, I've found a task per 3 days is fairly consistent across
teams and types of work.

When you set a date, you can work backwards from that date. You don't need
to do the whole [working backwards
process](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/an-insider-look-at-amazons-culture-and-processes)
-- just imagining the outcome you're aiming for and how it will launch is
always useful. Let's say you want to launch in one month, July.
July has 23 working days. (Don't just use calendar days, humans take time
off.) If you have a single engineer, they can do about 7 tasks in that
time. Can you break down the work into roughly 7 chunks? Can you scope
some of it into the 7 tasks you have space for? If you want to buffer in
risk, assume you really can do only 5 tasks. Now what would remain in
scope? Or should you move the date?

I find engineers are overly afraid of this question, "what should happen
when dates need to change?" If you've factored your work as described
above, it's easier to talk about what features can be in and out of scope
in the timeframe. Dates and features can be renegotiated, but when
negotiating you need real trade-offs. Being able to concretely trade
features with time earns trust. If you don't do it, you will find your
manager doing it for you, and that sets the ceiling on your autonomy. You
may find that preferable, but let's come back to that.

# affect

**Affect** is a subtle word, and I am using it from psychology to roughly
mean: how you feel, how others experience your feelings, and how their
experience of your feelings makes them feel. Of course, that can complete
a circuit in changing your feelings based on their response.

Why do I say affect is a _tool_? That sounds a little creepy at first,
I think. But part of adulthood is at absolute minimum not having temper
tantrums to get what you want. (What psychology calls "emotional
self-regulation.") In stressful situations or situations with high
ambiguity or high conflict (which tend to become stressful) affect is
critical, because affect changes how we respond - how we make decisions,
how we act.

The main tool of affect should be: _how do I remain calm, and increase
calm in others, so we can make good decisions?_

But I'd be lying to you if I said negative emotions, like anger, never
have their place in emphasizing the impact of an action to others. That
is, if someone ships a bug, I think it's okay to furrow your brow and be
slightly annoyed. I also think it's fine for a debate about a decision to
become a bit "heated," as long as there's a cool-down recovery to affirm
respect between the participants after.

What I think is less okay is a common pattern I've seen with "rising"
engineers: contempt as affect. Sometimes engineers learn that an affect of
"I know better than you" (contempt for the opinions of others) is a way to
express their frustration. It's true we can end up in scenarios where
people say and do very stupid things, and this can be frustrating. But
I've never once seen the affect of contempt help someone grow, on either
side. What I have seen is that it actually suggests a kind of insecurity
mixed with resentment in not being noticed yet: "why doesn't leadership
see me as a peer yet? Why must I convince these people of what's right?"

The answer to those questions are other questions: how do you feel about
your leadership when they don't seem calm and confident? Why isn't what
you're proposing already self-evident? Friend, what if you are the problem
here?

Fixing affect is hard. I suggest starting with learning what [affect
tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_(psychology)#Affect_tolerance)
is and taking notes on how you feel in different situations. One practical
tip I think works is to consider likely responses and specifically tell
yourself how you'll react when it happens. "I know X always harps on Y,
but when X does that this time it's not going to bother me, I am going to
be chill and just say how Y's risk is minimized because of Z and then
change the subject. If they don't accept this I'll ask them to help me
brainstorm later on how _they_ can help to fix Y forever."

_For me_, I personally think that radical personal responsibility has
helped me the most here. I directly say to myself if my affect is bad (I'm
getting frustrated and expressing it) that's really strong evidence **I am
being ineffective.** It's time to step back and say "okay monkey brain,
you had a turn, but I need to take some time to think and approach this
differently now."

# agency

How does one become more effective? I don't think it is something that is
only done "to" you by others. Ultimately you become more effective because
you exercises your own agency somehow.

I firmly believe people can be taught to have more agency. The biggest
blocker in having agency is simply wanting it at all.

There's a two red flags I notice in low-agency thinking: i. explicit
abdication, eg. "I need to check with ..." (the team, a manager, etc.),
ii. implicit abdication, which usually takes the form of complaining
repetitively about a problem without clarifying the problem enough to find
a solution or resisting ownership of the solution.

There's times to hand off agency to authority: _because you can't take
responsibility for the outcome._ I'd ask you to consider very seriously
how much of your life you want to play that way. I think the answer is not
100%, and not 0%. It is somewhere in between. But it shocks me how little
people give this any conscious consideration.

I mention **dates** and **affect** first because I think they're strong
inputs into agency. Dates are really about getting comfortable with owning
the future, taking direct responsibility for it in a measurable way with
others. Calm, strong affect (your internal emotional landscape) is needed
because agency means actually doing things with stakes. Higher agency
guarantees you will fail sometimes, because you actually put yourself on
the line.

But it also means you're much more likely to get what you want. One
additional input is required there that I can't write anything about: how
you get in touch with what you want to accomplish in your life.

What I can recommend is again that you notice what you feel and what you
do. I'll give an example from my life. I learned how to run quite late in
life, which made a large difference in my physical and I think mental
well-being. I noticed that I was sometimes making excuses for why I didn't
run on a certain day or in a certain setting, eg., I wasn't running home
from work because I said to myself my backpack isn't a running backpack.
Two obvious things: one, well then go get the right backpack, right? But
actually the first thing I did was simply tried it even with my
"sub-optimal" backpack. It was actually not horrible and I learned a bit
about what I'd actually want from a more optimal backpack.

The simplest heuristic is to write down and investigate when you make
excuses to do something or not do something. Then begin interventions of
this form: what's the simplest thing I could do to get more information?
I like this framing because you may be waiting for something to tell you
how to act, but you can already take actions of the form "how can I take
a measurement here to understand the situation?" You'll be taking an
action that has a result you can interpret for your next action. It's
a good feedback loop. If you can't think of any good ideas, give yourself
permission to use your first bad idea.
