<br>
<p>I’m a programmer with a “non-traditional” background. This means I have a lot to learn. I like to think it also means I have unique tools to learn with.</p>

<p>My professional focus so far has been Web APIs, especially REST and hypermedia. I wrote a <a href="http://mooreniemi.github.io/hypermedia-presentation/#/">presentation on RESTful Web APIs</a>. My current toolkit includes: Ruby, vim (see my <a href="https://gist.github.com/mooreniemi/24f3e2f929d76549b052d35b93104a69">~/.vimrc</a>), TDD, Kanban, and pair programming. I like working on <a href="https://github.com/mooreniemi/mgmt/blob/master/self-organizing-team-contract.md">self-organizing teams</a>.</p>

<p>I’m interested in functional programming, type systems, and programming history generally. I have a sidebar in the upcoming book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Developer-Testing-Building-Addison-Wesley-Signature-ebook/dp/B01LHSV9ZI">Developer Testing</a> on how to think about types as a way of extending design by contract.</p>
