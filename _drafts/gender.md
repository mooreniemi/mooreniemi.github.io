title: on gender expectations
---

I know a lot of programmers who started when they were children. Then they
did tons of competitions and Google Summer of Code and were students in CS
programs and had awesome internships at known companies like Facebook, and
so on. The vast majority with those histories are men.

Well, not me. I'm a late bloomer.

I was an artist with a BFA in film. In between gigs, I poured coffee every
day as a barista. In an odd twist of fate, I served a product manager I'd
go on to work with. I remember finding her mug from that coffeeshop in our
workplace dishwasher.

### origin story

While working at my first tech job I was outted as
[transgender](http://www.glaad.org/transgender/transfaq). I was working as
a community manager, and because a community member had broken rules, they
were banned from the community. This wasn't only my choice, so I hope
you'll take it on faith it wasn't some petty vendetta on my part. My boss,
the director of marketing, agreed this person needed to go.

The banned member's response was to dig up dirt on me. They found pictures
of me as a little girl, and pictures of me naked, and made a blog
"exposing" me as someone not trustworthy as a community manager _because_
I am transgender. Then they sent it to all community members and my
coworkers.

This person, of course, was never punished.

Yet, I was lucky[^1]. My coworkers were liberal, and it didn't hurt my job
directly to be outted. But it shook me really deeply. I remember thinking
to myself at the time: "if I want to be safe, I need to have a job where
I don't interact with people as directly, and I need to be the *best* at
that job to survive."

I looked around and saw one of the safest jobs for trans people I knew was
programming, so I started transitioning into programming full time. It
turned out I loved programming. I **love** programming. 5 years later, I'm
a software engineer, and sometimes I wonder to myself: why did it take so
long for me to discover this?

### growing up

When I was 12 I first saw a classmate programming BASIC: the simple
infinite loop that prints "HELLO WORLD" forever. When I asked how he did
it he said I wouldn't be interested. When I asked why, he ignored me and
showed another boy present how to do it.

To me, programming was (and actually still is) deeply intertwined with
math. Growing up as a girl, I was bad at math. Every message I got was
I was bad at math _because_ I was a girl.

Interestingly, I was also bad at reading and writing when I first tried.
(I went on to be considered "gifted" in that area and skipped a grade on
that basis.) But while my mom was prepared to tutor me in English, she
herself had never picked up math skills. Her attitude towards math was
reflected all around me by teachers: girls just don't take to it.

So I gave up once I hit middle school and never made it back out of
remedial classes. I was deeply ashamed of this and figured it meant I had
no future outside of, perhaps, the arts. It saddens me to consider that by
high school I felt my future was totally fixed.

When I was 17 I was visiting a friend's house and saw his desktop looked
very different than mine. He smirked and explained it was Linux but,

> "That's not for girls really."

It wouldn't be until I was 27 that I got the guts together to try Ubuntu.

### on gender

When I became a man, I noticed something, and I've not been the [only
transgender
man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Barres#Experience_of_sexism) to
notice it.

Everyone just took me at my word when I said I was a programmer. In fact,
in certain situations where my tech job could've been ambiguous, people
assumed I must be a programmer. While they were right, what was their
basis for thinking so other than that I am a white man and pass for
straight and don't dress quite as well as people on the product team?

I was also quite shocked to observe that men stopped patronizing me the
same way. What used to have the flavor of dismissal now tasted bitterly of
competition when it appeared. I realized I still preferred working with
women even as a man because their interactions were on the whole so much
more collegial. I knew early on in my career I wanted to work places that
prioritized diversity.

I found this a controversial opinion. I recall one of my first
conversations with a Silicon Valley coworker which went something like
this:

> me: I like that I can look around and not everyone here looks like me.

> him: I don't care really. What does it matter if everyone looks like us?
I only care that they're the **best**.

Programming, he said, was open to anyone. All it takes is some interest,
say, in making Minecraft mods, and from there nobody can stop your innate
talent. The suggestion perhaps being, if we don't see black people or
women here, perhaps it is only because they have no interest or ability?

I didn't try to explain to him that when you spend your lifetime being
expected to have no interest or ability in something, the likelihood that
you will discover either or both falls sharply. When you are
young, and even when you are an adult sometimes, you tend to believe what
other people believe about your limitations.

It took 25 years for me to discover something I've found challenging,
rewarding, fun, fascinating, and lucrative because **nobody expected me
to**--including myself.
