I'm a programmer with a "non-traditional" background. This means I have a lot to learn. I like to think it also means I have unique tools to learn with.

My professional focus so far has been Web APIs, especially REST and hypermedia. I wrote a [presentation on RESTful Web APIs](http://mooreniemi.github.io/hypermedia-presentation/#/). My current toolkit includes: Ruby, vim (see my [~/.vimrc](https://gist.github.com/mooreniemi/24f3e2f929d76549b052d35b93104a69)), TDD, Kanban, and pair programming. I like working on [self-organizing teams](https://github.com/mooreniemi/mgmt/blob/master/self-organizing-team-contract.md).

I'm interested in functional programming, type systems, and programming history generally. I have a sidebar in the upcoming book [Developer Testing](https://www.amazon.com/Developer-Testing-Building-Addison-Wesley-Signature-ebook/dp/B01LHSV9ZI) on how to think about types as a way of extending design by contract.
